# GeauxWeisbeck4.dev Version 2.0

The Second version of GeauxWeisbeck4.dev. Version 2.0 was built with Deno and Lume, an awesome Static Site Generator. I spent a lot of time debating between Aleph.js and  Fresh, but ultimately Lume was the most familiar and worked the best for this project.

## Why the tech stack and why a new website?

Well I am absolutely in love with Deno now and will use it unless I have no other choice to. I chose Lume because it made it easy to create a portfolio site in a reasonable amount of time - any other framework has me sitting there for to long messing around with what I want to do with my personal site. I know that probably makes no sense and it probably doesn't. That's ADHD for you.

When I finally settled on what technology I would use for the site, I sort of just went at coding it without designing a layout or anything. I don't recommend that to anyone, but it kind of worked for now. I am going to continue to tidy this project up but I like it so far. Nothing too special, but it gets the job done.

## Features to be implemented...

Yes I have a wish list:

- [ ] Add Supabase 
- [ ] Add my dashboard
- [ ] Add a commenting system
- [ ] Add a music dashboard with my top bangers
- [ ] Convert to JSX
- [ ] Add Documentation to site

## Star if you like my site! Thank you!

It's also totally cool if you want to use this site to make your own.
