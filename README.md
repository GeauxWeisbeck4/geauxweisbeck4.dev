# GeauxWeisbeck4.dev Version 2.0

The Second version of GeauxWeisbeck4.dev. Version 2.0 was built with Deno and Lume, an awesome Static Site Generator.

## Why the tech stack and why a new website?

Well I am absolutely in love with Deno now and will use it unless I have no other choice to. I chose Lume because it made it easy to create a portfolio site in a reasonable amount of time - any other framework has me sitting there for to long messing around with what I want to do with my personal site. I know that probably makes no sense and it probably doesn't. That's ADHD for you.

I've actually been trying to create this new personal website for like 2 months. Yeah...

## Features to be implemented...

Yes I have a wish list:

- [ ] Add a Postgres DB
- [ ] Add my dashboard
- [ ] Add a commenting system
- [ ] Add a music dashboard with my top bangers

## Star if you like my site! Thank you!
